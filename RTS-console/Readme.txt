It uses SFML 2.4 to work properly.

make -> compile.
make clean -> clear all .o files.
make mrproper -> clear all.

If you can't run it just try to download to official release of sfml :
	$ sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

If you can't compile it try to use an other version on c++ compiler (1.19) :
	$ sudo apt-get install g++-1.19 gcc-1.19


Feel free to ask any questions you would like to, participation will also be greatfull, i'll do my best ton answer quickly !*

Cu in the game :)
